# IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate: Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift

These are my notes of the course [Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift?specialization=devops-and-software-engineering).

I have some related repositories in which I compile a guide on Docker; this course is suposed to focus on Kubernetes.
