# IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate: My Guide

These are my personal notes of the [IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering) from Coursera.

The specialization is composed by 14 courses:

1. Introduction to DevOps
2. Introduction to Cloud Computing
3. Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum
4. Introduction to Software Engineering
5. Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting
6. Getting Started with Git and GitHub
7. Python for Data Science, AI & Development
8. Python Project for AI & Application Development
9. [Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift?specialization=devops-and-software-engineering)
10. Application Development using Microservices and Serverless
11. Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)
12. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
13. Application Security and Monitoring
14. DevOps Capstone Project

**Each course has a dedicated folder which contains a `README.md` with a guide and all necessary files in it**. Most of the topics are not new to me, so I have not been very detailed in parts that I am familiar with.
